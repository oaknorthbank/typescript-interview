## Running the project

You'll need NodeJS v18.

- `npm install`
- `npm test` should run the tests
- `npm run dev` should run the main file

## Context

This project contains a first version of a function that calculates a credit score given a credit report.

**Credit score:** A credit score is a prediction of a person's credit behavior, such as how likely you are to pay a loan back on time, based on information from your credit reports. In our current implementation, the credit score values are: 900 (excellent), 700 (good), 600 (fair), 500 (poor), 400 (very poor).

**Credit report:** consists of a person's credit utilisation percentage and payment history.

- Credit utilisation percentage: TODO...
- Payment history: is a list of invoices that the person needs to pay.

## Task

During the interview, we'll ask you to expand the current implementation of the credit score function. You'll have around 35 minutes for this.

Before the interview, please:

- Make sure you can run the project locally (`npm test` should run the tests in watch mode).
- Get familiar with the existing code.
- Don't write any code.
